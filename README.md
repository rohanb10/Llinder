# Llinder

A simple website to introduce Llinder, a new dating app for llamas of all ages.

The webpage was built using only html and css.

Most of the web pages I make tend to be very reliant on javascript, jQuery or other frameworks like Bootstrap and more recently, MeteorJS. I wanted to avoid doing this and try writing something using only css.

The primary focus of this project was to implement smooth parallax scrolling and make the webpage responsive as well.

Physical devices used to test the responsiveness of this webpage:

	Mac OSX 10.10.5
		Screen Size: 13.3 in
		Resolution: 1440 x 900
		Browsers: Safari (v8.0.8), Chrome (v45.0.2)

	Android 5.1.1
		Screen Size: 4.6 in
		Resolution: 720 x 1280
		Browsers : Chrome Dev (v47.0.25)

Some other devices were simulated using Chrome dev tools
